## Limitations

This tool is fully automated and relies entirely on data maintained by third parties. No data collected by the SNSF itself is used in any form or manner. As scholarly publishing is a highly complex endeavour, no database of scholarly publications will ever be 100% complete or correct in all cases. Therefore please use the results of this tool responsibly and with caution.

__Data__

* Only articles are analysed. Due to the lack of coverage of other publication formats by all relevant databases, a useful analysis beyond articles is not possible.

* Publication lists might be incomplete. Lists are obtained through Dimensions, which has quite high coverage but still misses some articles, especially if they do not have a DOI or are not in English. Especially in the social sciences and humanities as well as mathematics there are some gaps in coverage.

* Publication lists might include articles by unexpected authors. Author disambiguation is done by Dimensions. Their database contains algorithmically extracted and disambiguated researchers, irrespective of the form their names may take in the original source documents. There might be misassignments, especially for authors with very few publications or for authors with very common names.

* Metadata on open-access characteristics might not be up-to-date. Unpaywall harvests thousands of sources to accumulate open access specific metadata on scholarly publications. Although this data reaches a very high quality, some sources might still be missing or the database may not have been updated yet.


__Interpretation__

* No distinction between author positions. The analysis does not differentiate between first, last or corresponding authors.

*	No bronze open access. SNSF regulations do not require a specific licence for articles, and therefore there is no "bronze" open access category.
