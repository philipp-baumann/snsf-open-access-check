## FAQs

__How can I improve my OA status?__

In addition to publishing in open journals in the future, it is often possible to make older articles openly available by uploading them to an institutional or discipline-specific repository. More information can be found in the [OA guidelines of the SNSF](https://oa100.snf.ch/en/funding/guidelines/).

__Why can't the tool find me?__

The tool finds authors who have an automatically generated author profile on Dimensions. Although coverage of these authors is very high, it is far from complete. Coverage particularly in mathematics as well as the humanities and social sciences is lower than in other disciplines, as this correlates with the database’s coverage of publications in those disciplines.

__Why does the tool find me more than once?__

Management of author profiles is an automated process performed by Dimensions. Sometimes the algorithm has difficulty in assigning different publications with the same author name to one specific author. In such cases you can select several author names if you know that they are the same person. The publications of the author names you selected will then be merged for the report.

__Some of my publications do not appear in the report, how can this be?__

The report is limited to scholarly articles. The tool relies on Dimensions to generate lists of articles. Although their coverage is quite high and continually improving, it is not 100%.

__The report contains articles that are not mine; how can this be?__

If this is the case, the algorithm disambiguating authors has merged two authors with similar names under the same profile. The best thing to do is to file a request to correct your profile at [Dimensions](https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication): Support -> Send Feedback.

__How can it be that the OA status of some of my articles is not correctly classified?__

We derive the classification for the report from OA metadata delivered by Unpaywall. Articles are assigned to different open access categories, if they fulfill certain criteria as defined by the SNSF’s open access regulations. (For details see “Data and Methods”.) This can for example lead to an article not being classified as “green OA” but as “other OA” because the openly available version is not the published or the accepted version of an article – which is needed for the SNSF to acknowledge an article being “green OA”. In rare cases the article might even be the correct version, just not recognised and indicated as such by Unpaywall. There is also a time lag between articles being published and being recognised as OA, since publisher sites and repositories need to get be indexed by Unpaywall first.

__For some articles marked as closed, I as a secondary author was not able to influence open or closed publishing. Nevertheless these articles count into my statistics, can't I remove them?__

Author position is not evaluated in the workflow. Since the roles of first, last or corresponding author differ to a great extent between disciplines, there is no reliable way to determine who might be responsible for the publishing mode of a given article.

__In my discipline, there are fewer open-access journals than in other disciplines - how can I still succeed in having a high OA share?__

The green road of self-archiving a publication in an institutional or disciplinary repository works irrespective of the dominant publishing model within a given discipline. Most publishers require observance of an embargo period of 6 to 24 months before authors have the right to make their manuscripts openly available. Information on the self-archiving policies of journals can be found at [SHERPA/RoMEO](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/). The SNSF highly recommends uploading the author’s accepted manuscript (including revisions after peer-review) to a repository at the time of publication, indicating the embargo period to be respected.

__Can I get the code of the application?__

Yes, the application is open source and released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). You can view the code and clone the project's repository on [our Github page](https://github.com/snsf-data/snsf-open-access-check).
